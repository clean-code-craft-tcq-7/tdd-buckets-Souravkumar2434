Software Requirements:-

1) the input data should be valid
   a) Input should be a list type
2) Continuous Range should be found
   a) for a single value it should be empty
   b) for empty list also it should be empty
3) Number of readings in a continuous range should be found
4) Output of the continuous range and number of readings should be in a csv format
5) The software should consider readings from 0 - 4094 as valid i.e 0 - 10amps for 12-bit A2D converter.
	a) A value over 4094 is invalid and it should be discarded.
	b) A2D value to current value conversion mechanism should be there and it should be rounded off to nearest integer.
6) The software should consider readings from 0 - 1-23 as valid i.e -15amps - 15amps for 10bit A2D converter.
    a) Absolute value of current should be considered for calculating range.

Assumptions:-

1) Continuous range for single value should be empty.


Test Requirements:-

1) To validate input data
   a) pass string as input data, the function should return False as output.
   b) pass list as input data, the function should return True as output.

2) To find continuous range
   a) pass [], continuous range should be [].
   b) pass [1] as input, continuous range should be [].
   c) pass [4,5] as input, continuous range should be [[4,5]].
   d) pass [4,5,6] as input, continuous range should be [[4,6]].
   e) pass [4,6,5,7] as input, continuous range should be [[4,7]].
   f) pass [4,5,6,9,8,10] as input, continuous range should be [[4,6], [8,10]].

3) To find number of readings in continuous range:-
   a) pass [], number of readings should be [].
   b) pass [4,5] as input, number of readings should be [2].
   c) pass [4,5,6] as input, number of readings should be [3].
   d) pass [4,6,5,7] as input, number of readings should be [4].
   e) pass [4,5,6,9,8,10] as input, number of readings should be [3, 3].

4) To check output of program in csv format:-
   a) pass continuous range as [[4, 5]] and number of readings as [2], output should be "Range, Readings\n4-5, 2"
   b) pass continuous range as [[4, 5], [7, 8]] and number of readings as [2, 2], output should be "Range, Readings\n4-5, 2\n7-8, 2"

5) To convert the 12 bit A2D value in amps:-
   a) pass 0 as input, current value should be 0amps.
   b) pass 4094 as input, current value should be 10amps.
   c) pass 4095 as input, invalid input should be returned.
   d) pass 1146 as input, current value should be 3amps.
   
6) to find continuous range and number of readings when 12bit A2D values are passed:-
   a) pass [0, 400, 700, 1146] as input, continuous range and number of readings should be ([[0, 3]], [4]).
   b) pass [0, 400, 700, 1146, 2047, 2456, 4095] as input, continuous range and number of readings should be ([[0, 3], [5, 6]], [4, 2]).
   c) pass [4095, 4096, 4097, 4098, 4099] as input, continuous range and number of readings should be ([], []).
   
7) To convert the 10-bit A2D value in amps:-
   a) pass 0 as input, current value should be -15amps.
   b) pass 511 as input, current value should be 0amps.
   c) pass 1022 as input, current value should be 15amps.

8) to find continuous range and number of readings when 10bit A2D values are passed:-
   a) pass [0, 34, 68, 102] as input, continuous range and number of readings should be ([[12, 15]], [4]).
   b) pass [0, 34, 68, 102, 511, 545, 580] as input, continuous range and number of readings should be ([[0, 2], [12, 15]], [3, 4]).
   c) pass [1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028] as input, continuous range and number of readings should be ([], []).
